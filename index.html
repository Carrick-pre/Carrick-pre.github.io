							lovely
							The Nature of Code book </a>
					<li> python, not a fan at all of pyhton but I appreciate how nicely it allows some tasks to be
						done. for example the buttons at the end of this page the html was creted by a pythong
						script.
					<li> C, I am starting to learn c as I do want to be able to use lower level programming
						languages. I kinda love the idea of using a lang so old and so understood and simple in its

			<h2>Here are some cool lynks from across the cyberSpace</h2>

				<h4> Sometimes I read ! </h4>
			</center>
			<p> I do really like books, I am not reading enough books the last few years I'll be honest.
				I drive a lot these days and tend to listen to my books more often than not. But I still try and read a
				few a year. This year 2023, I have been so busy its not fair, I tend to just collaspe into bed, or look
				for pictures for this v. silly webzone.

				I used to read almost every night and I need to get back into that habit. I am convinced the reason why
				I am so badly near-sighted now as an adult is that as a kid I would be very very very often up into the
				wee hours of morning reading by any and all light sources that where assesciable.

			<ul>Some books I have read listened to this year</ul>
			<li>A Canticle for Leibowitz</li>
			<p>I am not sure about this book, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Canticle_for_Leibowitz"> WIki
					Link !</a>its good, don't get me wrong, but I dont think I can reccomend it to everybody, you need
				to have a certain type of brain rot to get a lot out of this book. That being said, it is funny and
				engaging. If you Like fallout or post apopalytica in general, go read this book.
				It does have a lot more humour and just good natured fun that I would have thought, and as it was
				published from short stories in 1959, it has that lovely crust of retro futurism where the talking
				machines of the future are still using mechanical gears and vaccum tubes. I'ts good one thing it suffers
				from is a lack of direction, stuff happens and while there is an overarching plot and themes and what
				have you, it doesnt quite build to a crescendo.
				I need to read the sequel that was published nearly 40 years after the release of this. Though the guy
				wrote it in a depressive state.

				I overall loved the presentation and the whimsy it had, at times it would break down some of this whimsy, sometimes affectively like 
				having the abbot argue agaisnt the fact that the goverment was suiciding people, 
				others while still good it came across a little heavy handed or blundering. 

				The short stories made book was nice as well, it spans across several hundred years of work, and you get to see reocurring themes and how 
				relgion in the region swims and sways from basically proto- medival to futuristic. 
				In short, it is good. Will not change your life or anything but a very solid book. It brings in retro-futurism modernism and the place of relgion after we have killed god. 

				I have always loved the idea of the modern age in earnst is when we split the atom and by virtue servered all human subordination to the gods then, 
				and this book is defiently a musing on that idea as well as refutation. It manages to stay fresh and engaging by not being preachy, while a modern reader (espically that of an Irish ex Roman Catholic)
				will have 60 more years of baggage and knowledge of the power and rampant abuse that our real churches have done agaisnt our people. 

				I give it a strong 4/5 radiated rats. 

				<center><img src="images/books/A_Canticle_for_Leibowitz_cover_1st_ed.jpg"> </center>
			</p>
			<li> Neuromancer, William gibson </li>
			<p> This is the most recent book I have finished to date. Honestly maybe I'm dumb but the plot was all over the shop,
				and at times ridicously hard to follow. Just like the author the name of whom is the prize that he won for this book, (K. dick)
				it's very self evident from the prose that gibson was on drugs for a lot of the time he was writing this book. In particular the fact that case the main character, the readers analogue 
				is a drug addict. It's clear gibson loved coke and speed at any rate. I dont have any issue with that myself but even when he describes wild future drugs 
				it doesnt have the imagination that dick would with such subject matter.

				Theres very little emotions or real depth to any of the characterizations in the book, nobodies motives are ever exammined at any depth, 
				while there is a bit of politics in the book, it's almost verbaitm from that of the scence in blade runner where in neo los angles where you see the asian woman drinking coca-cola. 
				<center> <img src ="images/cola.jpg"></center>
				What I mean by that is its all shorthand and some of it coming from a place of ignorance and fear mongering more so that of art. 
				
				Japan-aphobia mixed in with the idea that we will both wreck the planet and also get to dick around inspace, there is also very cringe 
				rasta's in the book. I do like how dub is almost a relgious rite in gibson's vision of the world though. you can just tell this gibson guy is ridc white. 

				In short I am in two minds. It's clearly something. The depections of 'The Matrix' as well as some of the more esoteric full new ideas such as the Tessier-Ashpool family, While I loved just the wraped,
				so rich that they are like gods messing with the rest of the people and create basically new forms of life, they are brought a little too rushed or something into the story and their actual motives and whole 
				philosphy are muddled as a result. 

				I know that you dont and shouldnt explain anything but most of the characters lack motivation and there is literally a deus ex machima for a lot of the story. 

				That all being said it is a decent book, and perhaps in some ways as it was fundamental or borrowed heavily from the parlance of sci-fi cyberpunk of the time. Maybe some of the intial 
				sting was taken out of the delivery. That being said maybe why I personally couldnt fall completly under the spell of this book was that I was getting reminded of cyberpunk 2077 a lot, And that game really dissapointed me. 

				I would give it 4/5. but very light 4.

			<h5>Sci Fi Books I think you should read !</h5>
			<p> I have always been into sci books since I started reading, as a kid the coolest bit of Sci/Fi fantasy
				books was
				the tech or magic, but as I grew into my teenage years and now as an adult I kinda see that the most
				intersting part of any good fiction book
				is not the tech or whatever, its the exammination of normal (Mostly) human behavior in un-ordinary
				situations and the philosphy and emotions and all that fluff
				that comes out of these situations.


				<center>
					<h5> CARRICK'S TOP FIVE SCI FI BOOKS</h5>
				</center>
				<li>1) The left hand of darkness by Ursula K. Le Guin </li>
			<p> I have had gone trough my hands five copies of this book, I keep buying a copy to reread it every 2
				years or so just to then pass my copy to anybody I think I can force to read it,
				its just masterful. It very akin or similar to that of a, just more mature and more emotional & more
				intimate Asimov, the very measured and well invisioned world, with the very very nicely done in universe
				antropological reports and just a great take on the world,
				for as early as it is, it's still fresh. I think that is an aspect that still shocks me. I've read the
				book at least 5 times now, and still even writing this I just want to go trough the journey again.

				The framing of the book is great as well, we look trough the eyes of a average as you get human, who sees everthing for 
				the first time along with us but has this respect and decorum that not many writers can give such a character. 
				hes the 1950's archyatype of the perfect antrhopologist.

				Honestly though, it's great. Gender benders in space with ice would be the elevator sell. But that does
				it a in justice.
				It has in it a level of intimacy between two characters that is lacking from a lot of sci fi books.
				<center> <img src="images/books/lefthand.jpg"></center>
			</p>
			<li> This one is a bit obligatory and to be honest this is just a place holder </li>
			</p>

			<h5>Online / Ebooks you can read for freee right now! </h5>
			<p> here is just a few books or book like things that I think are worthwhile. I think the Internet is at its
				best where it lets some very niche very cool stuff just escape out into the world, where other people
				come and find this stuff and it gets into their heads. These are some examples of weird and v. cool
				stuff that defo did that to me. </p>
			<ul>
				<li>17776 Or the future of American Football <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/a/17776-football"> Click
						here !</a></li>
				<p> Now I hate sport ball, but honest to god if you have never encountered this before just go read it,
					its amazing. I dont want to spoil it, I think I will re read it and give it a proper review of sorts
					at some point. If I do <a href="">This link might work. </a> Honestly though read it its very
					asseciable, you'll laugh you'll cry its very satrical and funny while having a true stream of
					emotion and just scope to the whole thing that is very refreshing and still nearly 4 years later I
					have not seen the like of. The writer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Bois">Jon Bois</a>
					Also has a very good <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/jonbois"> You-Tube Chanel</a> I recomend
					his vid-jay-o on the olympic race.
					Very Very good, he also uses Hobbes as a profile picture which this website is in full support of
				</p>
				<center> <img src="images/books/17776.jpg" width=300px> </center>
				<li>All Tomorrows: A Billion Year Chronicle of the Myriad Species and Mixed Fortunes of Man</li>
				<p>
					<center><a
							href="https://web.archive.org/web/20061124141617/http://www.nemoramjet.com/alltomorrows.pdf">
							Available here </a> This book is great, really got into my head and under my skin.
						I was listening to the ebook version of this as I crashed and totaled my Nissan Almera. I am
						still not quite happy about that. The guy who did this book, I think hes doing another or he is
						revising the illustrations.
						Would reccomend tho. Its a creepy and very worthwhile read. I haven't read much exilstential
						body horror stuff but this is great. GO READ ITS FREE !
