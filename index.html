<p>Hello, I am carrick, and welcome to my webpage here on the internet. 
	I am 26 years old. I study with the confusers and hope to get a job working for ericsson. I like linux, wood working and big into music. I drive an old car and have a big subwoofer in it. I am fond of cats. she/her pronouns.

	<H2> Confuzer Languages i know of..</h2>
	<ul> 
	<li> java proably the strongest with java at the moment. As well as some of the fluff that comes with it, junit 5, maven ect <br> <img src = "java.gif"> <img src ="java1.gif">
	<li> html js css I hate all of these but i dont hate js the most. 
	<li>  C sound <a href = "https://csound.com/" > pretty nice little thingy for making the sound with a confuzer </a>
	<li> Processing. have some stuff later on in the page about that but i do like processing quite a bit. its based off js but has loads of nice libaries that make it feel more cohesive than js. nice ide as well as loads of nice tutorials. and the <a href = "https://natureofcode.com/"> lovely The Nature of Code book </a>
	<li> python, not a fan at all of pyhton but I appreciate how nicely it allows some tasks to be done. for example the buttons at the end of this page the html was creted by a pythong script. 
	<li> C, I am starting to learn c as I do want to be able to use lower level programming languages. I kinda love the idea of using a lang so old and so understood and simple in its form. like 32 keywords is kinda ridc. 
	<li> mysql and other stuff like that. I am not the best though. 
	<li> other silly stuff like i used to use gamemaker for years and proably understand those scripts a little..
