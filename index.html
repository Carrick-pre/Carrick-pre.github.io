						<p1> Ive been messing around with computers since the age of 12 or so. I build some myself. I have always had a desktop in my room</p1>
							<hr>
							<br>
							<p> IF you had asked me a year ago, what my favourite laptop was I would have looked you dead ass in the eye and said thinkpad.
								That is no longer the case, I had a pretty middling expierence with one that I bought this year an i7 whatever t-380, 
								and it was nothing but slow and I really did not much care for the style of keyboard that they went with. 
								that being said for about a decade I did use thinkpads and I still kinda wish I had a x220 with a modern specs. </p>

							<p>
								<img src="images/computer/laptop__explodingA.gif">
								<br>
								What happened to it.
							</p>
								
							<p>
								at the moment though I have to make do hp elite book g8 840, which Is quite decent, apart from a mildly disapointing keyboard.

							<p> I do think its a shame that we cant have just ugly laptops with <br>
								decent keyboards anymore and the x220 was such a lovely machine</p>
							</div>
						<hr>
							<p> When I was like 14/15 I had a phase of being obsessed with old computers still am obsessed with the asethics and looks of old computers, but I was using a ti994a and a zx spectrum, doing lil basic programmes and 
								playing games on them.

						<p> I think computers are one of the best things and by far the worst things to happen to us as

				<H2> Confuzer Languages i know of..</h2>
				<ul>
					<li> java proably the strongest with java at the moment. As well as some of the fluff that comes
						with it, junit 5, maven ect. Java duke is an icon <br>
						<center> <img src="images/java.gif"> <img src="images/java1.gif"></center>
					<li> html js css I hate all of these but i dont hate js the most.
					<li> C sound <a href="https://csound.com/"> pretty nice little thingy for making the sound with
							a confuzer </a> I have made a song with it, <a
							href="https://soundcloud.com/carrick/nearing-tenebrosity"> here </a>
					<li> Processing. have some stuff later on in the page about that but i do like processing quite
						a bit. its based off js but has loads of nice libaries that make it feel more cohesive than
						js. nice ide as well as loads of nice tutorials. and the <a href="https://natureofcode.com/">
							lovely
							The Nature of Code book </a>
					<li> python, not a fan at all of pyhton but I appreciate how nicely it allows some tasks to be
						done. for example the buttons at the end of this page the html was creted by a pythong
						script.
					<li> C, I am starting to learn c as I do want to be able to use lower level programming
						languages. I kinda love the idea of using a lang so old and so understood and simple in its
						form. like 32 keywords is kinda ridc.
					<li> mysql and other stuff like that. I am not the best though.
					<li> other silly stuff like i used to use gamemaker for years and proably understand those
						scripts a little..
					<li> I do not know c++ but want this rat on my page. </li>

			I think the show went on way too long for it to ever properly proper get to be a gem. But take it for what it is and what since the age of 12 
			I thought of it was, which is that of Scooby Doo for kids, it makes a lot more sense. and some of the weird and awkward choices are more forgiveable.
